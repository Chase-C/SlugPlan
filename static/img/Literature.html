<h1>Program Description</h1>
<p>The study of literature at UCSC is organized as an interdisciplinary field coordinated through a single Department of Literature, rather than through separate departments of English, modern languages, and classics. This structure fosters innovative and comparative approaches to literature among both faculty and students. Courses in the major encompass traditional literary history and interpretation as well as cross-cultural inquiry and current theoretical debates.</p>
<p>The literature major permits focused work in national literary traditions. Students may concentrate in English-language literatures; in French, German, or Italian; in Latin and/or Greek; or in Spanish/Latin American/Latino literatures. Alternatively, students may organize their studies by historical period. Students who choose pre- and early modern studies focus on early literary traditions from antiquity through the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the neo-classical period, while those engaged in modern literary studies concentrate on literature of the 18th, 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. In addition, the world literature and cultural studies concentration emphasizes non-Western literatures, literature in a global context, as well as non-literary forms of cultural production. Finally, the Literature Department also offers a concentration in creative writing in which, in addition to studying literature, students work with faculty in upper-division workshops to improve their own creative writing skills.</p>
<p>Literature majors at UCSC are trained in critical reading, writing, and thinking, as well as in literary interpretation. These skills have wide applicability: they may lead to careers in other media such as film, theater, video, the visual arts, and electronic media; and they offer avenues into related disciplines such as history, philosophy, psychology, sociology, anthropology, politics, and history of art and visual culture. Literature majors traditionally enter a wide variety of careers ranging from law and journalism to management, government, international studies, publishing, technical writing, and teaching at all levels.</p>
<p>The Literature Department faculty requires that all literature majors have basic proficiency in a second language. Proficiency in more than one language enhances understanding of any literature and culture. Graduate programs in literature and other humanities disciplines generally require competence in a language other than English.</p>
<h2>Program Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>Following is a summary of the program learning outcomes for the Literature B.A.:</p>
<p>Students who complete the literature major should emerge with the following knowledge and skills:</p>
<p>1. A capacity for critical analysis of texts that is attentive to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the formal structures, genres, and rhetorical strategies of different kinds of writing, public discourse, and media;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the historical and social contexts of such texts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the role cultural and linguistic difference play in the interpretation of texts read in translation and in a language not one's own.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Effective written communication that demonstrates the following abilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>to evaluate multiple interpretations of texts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to write effective argumentative prose;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to situate texts in relation to a critical/theoretical tradition;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to design and initiate a substantive independent project of research or creative activity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Experience reading a variety of texts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>from a breadth of world cultures and traditions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from different historical periods, including the pre-modern;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>originally written in languages other than English.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Letter Grade Requirement</h2>
<p>Letter grades are required for 75 percent of courses applied toward the literature major, including the senior seminar or thesis, which must be taken for a letter grade.</p>
<h2>Declaration of the Major or Minor</h2>
<p>Students must complete Literature 1 or its equivalent prior to declaring the major or minor. Students declare a major or minor in literature by completing and submitting a Proposed Study Plan and Declaration of Major/Minor petition. All students considering a literature major or minor should consult with staff and/or faculty advisers as early as possible and declare the major or minor before the end of their sophomore year. Transfer students are urged to declare their major or minor in their first quarter at UCSC.</p>
<h2><strong>Requirements of the Major</strong></h2>
<h2>Literature Major Options</h2>
<p>Students wishing to major in literature may choose either the standard literature major or the intensive literature major. The intensive literature major is recommended particularly for students who plan to continue their studies in graduate school. The requirements for the intensive major include the study of literature in two languages; advanced proficiency in a second language is therefore required.</p>
<h2>The Standard Literature Major</h2>
<p>The literature major requires: (1) basic proficiency in a second language; and (2) 12 courses in literature.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic language proficiency:</strong> One year (three quarters or equivalent) of college level study of a non-English language or demonstrated reading ability at this level.</li>
<li>The 12 required courses must include two lower-division and 10 upper-division courses.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lower-Division Courses</h3>
<p>Lower-division courses are introductions to critical reading and writing. Students should complete their lower-division coursework before beginning upper-division work.</p>
<p>Two lower-division courses are required:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Literature 1, Literary Interpretation: close reading and analysis of literary texts. This is a writing-intensive course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One Literature 61-series course: categories, methodologies, and problems of literary study, or one Literature 80-series course: topical, thematic, and comparative studies of literary and filmic texts. Literature 61 and Literature 80 courses are recommended for both majors and non-majors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Upper-Division Courses</h3>
<p>Upper-division courses provide detailed treatment of literary and theoretical problems, themes, and periods. Students are strongly encouraged to take courses across chronological periods and national boundaries. Students must successfully complete the language proficiency requirement before enrolling in Literature 102.</p>
<p>Ten upper-division courses are required:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Literature 101, Theory and Interpretation: approaches to literary and cultural theories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Literature 102, Translation Theory: approaches to literary and cultural translation, or one upper-division non-English literature course studied in the original language. Students must successfully complete the language proficiency requirement before enrolling in Literature 102</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Six upper-division courses in an area of concentration (described below)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two upper-division electives in literature</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Distribution requirements.</strong> Among the 10 upper-division courses, at least two must focus on literature written prior to the year 1750; one course must focus on non-Western literature or literature in a global perspective; and one course must focus on poetry. One of the upper-division courses may be a senior seminar, which can be used to satisfy the campus comprehensive (exit) requirement. Some courses fulfill more than one distribution requirement. A list of annual course offerings indicating distribution codes for each course is available in the department office and on the Literature Department web page at <a href="http://literature.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank" title="Literature Department">http://literature.ucsc.edu/</a>.</p>
<p>With prior permission from the literature undergraduate program director, one upper-division literature elective may be replaced by an upper-division course related to the student&#8217;s area of concentration and chosen from another program in the humanities, arts, or social sciences.</p>
<h2>The Intensive Literature Major</h2>
<p>The Intensive Literature major requires (1) advanced proficiency in a second language, and (2) 14 courses in literature.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Advanced language proficiency:</strong> in addition to the Standard Literature major requirement of one-year (three quarters or equivalent) of college-level study of a non-English language, or demonstrated reading ability at this level, students must complete at least two upper-division courses in a second-language literature studied in the original language. In many languages, two years of college-level study (or comparable ability) are needed before a student is prepared to enter an upper-division course. In a few languages (Greek, Latin, Middle Egyptian Hieroglyphs), less time is needed for this purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 14 required courses must include two lower-division and 12 upper-division courses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lower-Division Courses</h3>
<p>The same requirements apply as for the standard literature major. Students who choose the intensive literature major are required to achieve advanced proficiency in a second-language literature. Upper-division literature coursework requires completion of a lower-division language sequence or the equivalent.</p>
<h3>Upper-Division Courses</h3>
<p>The intensive major requires 12 upper-division courses. Distribution requirements for the intensive major are the same as those for the standard literature major. In addition, students must complete at least two courses in a second-language literature studied in the original language. As in the standard major, with prior permission from the literature undergraduate program director, one upper-division literature elective may be replaced by an upper-division course related to the student&#8217;s area of concentration and chosen from another program in the humanities, arts, or social sciences.</p>
<h2>The Concentrations</h2>
<p>The purpose of the upper-division area of concentration is to help students shape a coherent program of study. The department provides several defined concentrations, described below. For all concentrations except national/transnational literatures, texts may be read in the original language or in translation.</p>
<h2><a id="national-literatures" name="national-literatures"></a>National/Transnational Literatures</h2>
<p>These concentrations examine literature within the frameworks of particular languages or national and regional traditions. National/transnational concentrations require that texts be read in the original language.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>English-language literatures</strong><br/>
 The study of American and British literature, as well as literatures of other English-speaking peoples around the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>French literature</strong><br/>
 The study of French and Francophone literatures, languages, and cultural practices of France, Africa, and the Caribbean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>German literature</strong><br/>
 The study of the literature, language, and cultural practices of the German-speaking areas of central Europe including Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Greek and Latin literature</strong><br/>
 The study of the literature, languages, and cultural practices of ancient Greece and Rome. Students may choose to concentrate in Greek or Latin or both.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Italian literature</strong><br/>
 The study of Italian literature, language, and cultural practices from the Middle Ages to the present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spanish/Latin American/Latino literatures</strong><br/>
 The study of literatures, language, and cultural practices of Spain, Latin America, and Latino populations in the United States.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="creative-writing" name="creative-writing"></a>Creative Writing</h2>
<p>The Department of Literature offers a sequence of workshops from introductory through advanced levels in both poetry and fiction. Other activities available to interested students include participation in the production of literary journals on campus, attendance at readings by visiting writers, and use of a creative writing reading room.</p>
<p>Admission to this concentration is selective. Interested students are required to take one lower-division creative writing workshop at UCSC before applying to the creative writing concentration; however, students are strongly encouraged to complete two lower-division workshops (at least one at UCSC) before applying.</p>
<p>Students accepted into the concentration must complete three advanced writing workshops and a senior project (e.g., a group of stories, a significant portion of a novel, a collection of poems). To apply for admission to the creative writing concentration, students should submit a completed application form (available at the Literature Department office and at <a href="http://creativewriting.ucsc.edu/for-students/apply.html" target="_blank" title="UCSC Creative Writing web site">http://creativewriting.ucsc.edu/for-students/apply.html</a>) and a thoughtful selection from their work (7&#8211;10 pages of poetry or fiction). Once accepted into the concentration, students are required to declare (or redeclare) the major in literature. At that time, students should meet with their adviser to discuss plans for a senior project.</p>
<h2><a id="preandearly" name="preandearly"></a>Pre- and Early Modern Studies</h2>
<p>The interdisciplinary study of literatures and cultures from antiquity through the early eighteenth century, especially in Europe. This concentration includes the study of popular culture and everyday life as well as readings in masterpieces of classical, medieval, early modern (Renaissance), and neo-classical literature.</p>
<h2><a id="modern" name="modern"></a>Modern Literary Studies</h2>
<p>The study of literature of the eighteenth, nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries. This concentration examines ways in which modernity in general and literary modernism and postmodernism in particular emerge and develop in different countries and cultures.</p>
<h2><a id="worldlit" name="worldlit"></a>World Literature and Cultural Studies</h2>
<p>The study of literature and cultural production both within a global context and within specific histories and economies. Courses move beyond the literary text to include nonverbal forms of representation such as social movements and everyday life practices.</p>
<h2>Disciplinary Communication (DC) Requirement</h2>
<p>Students of every major must satisfy that major&#8217;s upper-division Disciplinary Communication (DC) requirement. Literature majors must satisfy the Disciplinary Communication requirement by passing Literature 101.</p>
<h2>Comprehensive Requirement</h2>
<p>Students must successfully complete Literature 101 before taking any comprehensive requirement.</p>
<p>Seniors must select one of the following options to satisfy the campus exit requirement:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Senior seminar.</strong> The senior seminar may be counted as one of the required upper-division courses. The senior seminar need not be in the student&#8217;s area of concentration. Several senior seminars are offered each quarter; extensive writing is required in all seminars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Senior thesis.</strong> A student who wishes to propose a senior thesis (30&#8211;40 pages) must apply to a Literature Department faculty sponsor at least two quarters before the projected date of graduation. The application must include a proposed subject, a brief outline, a bibliography, and a sample of previous written work. Only those students who have received written permission from a faculty supervisor may complete a thesis to satisfy the senior exit requirement. A student whose application has been approved may receive course credit toward the major for one independent study (course 195) in a literature concentration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For students in the creative writing concentration, a creative writing project under the supervision of a faculty member (Literature/Creative Writing 194 or 195) is required.</p>
<h2><a id="lit-minor" name="lit-minor"></a>The Literature Minor</h2>
<p>The minor in literature requires seven courses.</p>
<p>Two lower-division courses are required:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Literature 1, Literary Interpretation: close reading and analysis of literary texts. This is a writing-intensive course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One Literature 61-series course: categories, methodologies, and problems of literary study, or one Literature 80-series course: topical, thematic, and comparative studies of literary and filmic texts. Literature 61 and Literature 80 courses are recommended for both Literature minors and non-majors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Five upper-division courses are required:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Literature 101, Theory and Interpretation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Four other upper-division literature courses (except Creative Writing)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Literature minor does not require second-language proficiency or a senior seminar.</p>
<h2>General Information</h2>
<h3>Transfer Credit</h3>
<p>A student may petition to receive credit toward the lower-division requirements of the major or minor for up to two courses taken at other institutions. An introduction to literature course may be used to satisfy the Literature 1 course requirement. Any other literature course may be applied toward the Literature 61 or the Literature 80 course requirement.</p>
<p>Transfer students planning to major in literature are urged to complete the equivalent of one year of college-level study of a language other than English before entering UCSC.</p>
<h3>Creative Writing Courses</h3>
<p>Any qualified student may take creative writing courses for credit toward graduation. Only students accepted into the creative writing concentration, however, may use Literature/Creative Writing 180, 183, 194, and 195 to satisfy major requirements.</p>
<h3>Credit For Repeated Courses</h3>
<p>Courses that vary significantly in material or methodology from one presentation to the next may be repeated for credit and are so designated in the course description in the UCSC General Catalog.</p>
<h3>Advising</h3>
<p>Faculty advisers are available in the Literature Department office throughout each academic term; students may make appointments in advance to meet with them. Staff advisers are available by appointment and on a drop-in basis. Students are encouraged to consult with a faculty adviser once per quarter.</p>
<h3>Senior Checklist</h3>
<p>Three quarters before anticipated graduation, all literature majors must complete a checklist in collaboration with a department adviser. The purpose of the checklist is to confirm progress toward graduation and the satisfaction of all major requirements. Completion and approval of a senior checklist are required for graduation.</p>
<h3>Honors</h3>
<p>Honors in the literature major are awarded to graduating seniors who have earned a 3.70 to 3.89 grade- point average in their upper-division literature courses. Highest honors in the literature major are awarded to graduating seniors who have earned a 3.90 or higher grade-point average in their upper-division literature courses. Honors are not awarded in the minor.</p>
<h3>Opportunities for Study Abroad</h3>
<p>The University of California&#8217;s Education Abroad Program (EAP) operates study centers in countries throughout the world, all associated with host institutions of high academic standing. EAP serves over 1500 upper-division students from the nine UC campuses every year. Students who participate in a UC Education Abroad Program may petition to apply up to three upper-division courses from EAP toward the literature major, or two upper-division courses toward the literature minor.</p>
<h2>The Graduate Programs</h2>
<h3>The Doctoral Program</h3>
<p>The UCSC doctoral program in Literature offers an innovative multilingual and multidisciplinary approach to literary studies. The program is relatively small and students work closely with faculty throughout their graduate careers. They are encouraged to take advantage of the rich array of intellectual and cultural events, research clusters, and lectures offered on campus.</p>
<p>The doctoral program combines critical and independent thought with multilingual and global perspectives. Students work within and across five areas, each of which cuts across linguistic, national, and period boundaries: technologies of narrative; trans/post/emergent nationalisms; poetics, poetry, and experimental writing; materialism and material culture; and critical theory. In combination they allow students to blend critical approaches, literary traditions, and/or cultural archives in comparative, multilingual, and interdisciplinary projects. Students may also apply for the Creative/Critical concentration in the Ph.D. program.&#160;Students may&#160;apply for a designated emphasis on the literature doctoral diploma in programs such as Critical Race and Ethnic Studies, Feminist Studies, History of Consciousness, Latin American and Latino Studies, and Politics. Applications and requirements are available at the respective department offices.</p>
<p>The program requires significant literary work in two languages. All students are required to complete a minimum of two courses in a second-language literature in which 50 percent or more of the reading is done in the original language. The second literature must serve as a component of the qualifying examination.</p>
<p>The common requirements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Literature 200, Proseminar, to be taken in fall quarter of the first year;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Literature 201, Pedagogy of Teaching/Teaching Assistant Training, to be taken prior to or in conjunction with the first teaching assistant appointment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Twelve courses leading to the definition of an area of concentration. At least two of these must be in a second-language literature; at least one must focus on pre-1750 literature and culture. Up to four courses may be taken in other departments; up to three may be independent studies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Literature 291F, a two-credit advising course, each quarter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three quarters of supervised teaching experience;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Literature Department&#8217;s intensive three-week Graduate Summer Language Program or equivalent;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A qualifying examination consisting of three components: 1. a portfolio with a field statement and comprehensive bibliography, a topic statement, a paper of publishable quality, and a dissertation sketch; 2. translation examination; and 3. oral examination. The qualifying examination must be taken during the third year or first quarter of the fourth year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A prospectus outlining and defining the dissertation project. The prospectus identifies the research problem, methodologies, and case studies, with chapter outline, footnotes, and bibliography, and must be submitted within a quarter following the qualifying examination, but no later than the end of the fourth year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A dissertation (written in conjunction with Literature 299, Thesis Research).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For the creative/critical concentration, applicants submit additional creative writing samples of poetry, prose fiction, creative non-fiction or hybrid/cross genre. Entering students complete all the requirements for the literature Ph.D. with the addition of a creative/critical enhancement to their degree in the form of coursework, original creative work with critical introduction and, if desired, work in poetics, translation, form and/or critical writing from the perspective of writerly practices.</p>
<p>A master of arts (M.A.) degree is conferred upon request to doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) candidates who have successfully completed the literature Ph.D. qualifying examination or who have completed the coursework required for the doctorate (teaching assistant training and supervised teaching experience exempted) and elect to write a master&#8217;s thesis under the supervision of a faculty adviser.</p>
<p>More detailed information for prospective graduate students, including procedures for application and admission to graduate studies, examinations, and requirements for the doctor of philosophy degree, is available from the Division of Graduate Studies (<span class="link"><a href="http://graddiv.ucsc.edu/">http://graddiv.ucsc.edu</a>) and on the department web site: <span class="link"><a href="http://literature.ucsc.edu/">http://literature.ucsc.edu/</a>.</span></span></p>
<h2>The Master&#8217;s Program</h2>
<p>A separate master of arts degree program is intended for students whose aim is to deepen and expand their literary/critical training and to prepare for entry into a Ph.D. program at another institution. Priority for admission is given to students interested in underrepresented areas of study within the Literature Department&#8217;s offerings, such as the non-English language literatures and, more broadly, critical theory.</p>
<p>The M.A. program requirements may not be completed in less than one year; the maximum time to obtain a degree is two years.</p>
<p>The common requirements are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Literature 200, Proseminar, to be taken in fall quarter of the first year;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seven courses leading to the definition of an area of concentration. Up to two of these may be taken in other departments. One may be an independent study course;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Literature 291F, a two-credit advising course, each quarter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A thesis (written in conjunction with Literature 299, Thesis Research). Typically, a thesis will range in length from 35&#8211;50 pages, plus a bibliography.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Literature Department does not provide financial support to students pursuing the M.A. degree. Admission to the M.A. program does not constitute admission to the Ph.D. program. Students may not automatically transfer from the M.A. program into the Ph.D. program, but must reapply. Further information and application materials are available from the Division of Graduate Studies (<span class="link"><a href="http://graddiv.ucsc.edu/">http://graddiv.ucsc.edu</a>) and on the department web site (<span class="link"><a href="http://literature.ucsc.edu/">http://literature.ucsc.edu/</a>).</span></span></p>
<h2>Literature Designated Emphasis</h2>
<p>Graduate students in other programs may obtain a designated emphasis in literature on the Ph.D. degree by completing the following requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The student must have a faculty graduate adviser from Literature, who serves both on the qualifying examination committee and the dissertation reading committee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The student must prepare a significant piece of writing in the area of literature, such as a substantial seminar paper or a chapter of the doctoral dissertation. The adviser from Literature, in consultation with the student, determines whether a particular piece of writing meets this requirement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The student must take four graduate courses in literature. With the approval of the literature adviser, one of the four required graduate courses may be an independent study.</p>
</li>
<li>When the above requirements have been fulfilled, the formal steps to obtain the Designated Emphasis in Literature are:<br/>
<ul>
<li>The student should complete the Designated Emphasis Application form (<a href="http://literature.ucsc.edu/graduate/LITDesignatedEmphasisApp.pdf" title="PDF of Literature Department's Designated Emphasis Application">http://literature.ucsc.edu/graduate/LITDesignatedEmphasisApp.pdf</a><a href="http://literature.ucsc.edu/graduate/LITDesignatedEmphasisApp.pdf">)</a>, obtain the literature adviser's signature and submit the application with supporting documentation (copies of the Qualifying Examination and Dissertation Committee Nomination forms) to the Literature Department graduate program coordinator.</li>
<li>The Literature Department will notify the student and the home department of approval for the designated emphasis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
